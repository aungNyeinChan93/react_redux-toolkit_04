## üß© Key Concepts

- **Redux Slices:** Each feature (e.g., cats, dogs, posts) has its own slice for state and reducers.
- **Async Thunks:** Used for API calls (e.g., fetching cats, GitHub users, photos).
- **Component Organization:** Components are grouped by feature for better maintainability.
- **Routing:** All main pages are defined in `router.js` and rendered via `RouterProvider`.
- **Testing:** Example test files are provided in `src/tests/`.
